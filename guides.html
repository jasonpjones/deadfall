            I am a born and raised Arizona resident who has been addicted to hunting since the first time my dad took me out to the hills as a kid.
            Most of my skills were learned from him and the memories we share in the hills cannot be replaced. I currently reside in Morenci,
            Arizona and work as a Powerline Electrician in the copper mine. I have one daughter, Kensey, and a beautiful wife named Brieanna
            who supports my crazy habit 100%. Throughout my hunting career I have been fortunate enough to harvest several trophy quality
            animals including, Bull Elk, Coues Whitetail Deer, Mule Deer, and Black Bear. In recent years I have grown to appreciate helping other
            hunters be successful and that is what inspired me to co-create this unique outfitting service. My partner, my guides, and myself
            pride ourselves in putting forth the extra effort it takes to make a good hunt a great one. I spend hours, days, weeks, and months a
            year in the mountains I hunt. Between horseback riding, shed hunting, and running trail cameras I am able to consistently learn areas
            that offer great opportunities for a successful hunt.  I have a strong passion for rifles and reloading which has a direct positive
            impact on hunts I am involved in. Our outfit offers quality hunts and our efforts cannot be beat.
